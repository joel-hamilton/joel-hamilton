# Joel Hamilton

Hi there! I'm a Canada-based full-stack developer with 6 years experience building and shipping large-scale customer-facing apps. I also do a lot of tinkering and building, and I try to put as much of that up here as possible. If you're hiring (remotely or in London, ON), I'd love to talk!
